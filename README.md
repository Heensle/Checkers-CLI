A rendition of checkers on the command line.

This project has been on my to-do list for a while, and I finally got around to it. The interface creation was my favorite, as well as building the CheckerMech namespace, but unfortunately that was only a fraction of the project. The data retrieval was definitely the hardest, and as of writing this, I still haven't figured it out.

Concepts I learned on this project:

- Namespacing classes
- To a degree, classes themselves
- Various syntax conventions
